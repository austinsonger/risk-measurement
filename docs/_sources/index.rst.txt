Simple Risk Measurement
=======================

:doc:`Simple Risk Measurement </index>` is a collection of simplified and probabilistic risk assessment methods.

.. warning::
  I am gathering feedback. Send any and all critique to magoo@r10n.com, or via slack.

It is designed to enhance subject matter experts who work with risk, especially those who professionally mitigate risk.

Simple Risk Measurement is different from top-down methods founded by governance or compliance needs, and is instead meant to be useful to those who *personally contribute to mitigations*.

If you are motivated by risk problems, you may find this useful as the beginnings of a comprehensive and epistemic approach to risk.

You should be able to measure risk on a napkin or organize a rocket launch with these methods.

How does this help me?
------------------------------------------

You may be enthusiastic about some of the following risk problems:

Is a risk worth mitigating?
  We need to decide whether a risk is important enough to require our attention or investment. We must express the importance of a risk in quantitative terms if we want to inform these decisions.

Has a specific risk gotten better or worse?
  Risk can change over time, especially if we are actively mitigating them or are observing changes in the context they exist in.

Which mitigation option(s) should we choose?
  When presented with competing options with which we can mitigate a risk, we use methods to evaluate each option and inform a decision.

How do we measure many risks?
  It may become important to highlight areas of risk *inside* of many other risks. Sometimes, more focused areas can be our largest problems, and we must represent them.

Have we spent enough time identifying new risks?
  You may feel that not enough time has been spent exploring new risks. We can measure how likely efforts will be in uncovering new issues to mitigate, and if more risk assessment effort will be valuable.
