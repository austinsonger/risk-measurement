Hello World
===========
One :doc:`principle <principles>` of this method is that our methods should be portable to any form of risk. To get the hang of it, it helps to understand how widely flexible it is, for many industries.

Inline are links that lead into the use of estimation techniques into the industry itself.

.. tip::
  Your risks are unique. These examples might not apply to your risk. That is ok!

With this method, we structure risks as a :doc:`scenario </risk/scenarios>`, which will look similar to the examples below. Then, we :doc:`forecast </estimation/measurement>` the values associated with them. If these decisions are important, increase the :doc:`rigor </enterprise/index>` involved with the process.

An example in Cyber-Security
----------------------------

A `16 person panel`_ forecasted the likelihood of a critical vulnerability being exploited in widely deployed software.

.. admonition:: Scenario
  :class: attention

  Will a "Critical" Chromium exploit be discovered "in the wild" in September 2018?

  `Yes` with a likelihood of `1.64%`.

An example in Nuclear Safety
----------------------------
Nuclear is concerned with combinations of events that may result in core damage or other outcomes. `Expert elicitation techniques`_ in nuclear risk measurement are `common`_.

.. admonition:: Scenario
  :class: warning

  Will a pump failure result in core damage within the next year?

  `Yes` with a likelihood of `0.001%`

An example in Environmental Safety
----------------------------------
`Environmental impact organizations`_ use the `probabilistic risk assessment`_.

.. admonition:: Scenario
  :class: warning

  How much will next years mortality rate due to Fine Particles (PM2.5) decrease if we pass X regulation?

  Interval estimate: Reduction of *.001 -.05%* with *95%* confidence.

An example in Meteorology
-------------------------

The United States spends `billions`_ on weather forecasting and its associated infrastructure.

.. admonition:: Scenario
  :class: warning

  Will the east coast hurricane make landfall near our city before we can evacuate?

  `Yes` with a likelihood of `50%`.

.. _billions: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_forecasting

An example in Intelligence Analysis
-----------------------------------
All forms of `intelligence gathering`_ ultimately desire to `inform decision making`_.

.. admonition:: Scenario
  :class: warning

  Does the image taken by our satellite depict an adversary military aircraft?

  `Yes` with a likelihood of `70%`.
