Forecasting
-----------

.. _tetlock:

Philip Tetlock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tetlock's research revolves around how experts who are untrained in prediction are worse than random. He has since isolated those who are stronger forecasters (Superforecasters) and is identifying their qualities, especially around how someone a better forecaster, and how to further improve them with teams.

Meteorology
~~~~~~~~~~~
Maybe the oldest area of forecasting. Understanding the industrial development of meteorology is a great rubric for how a predictive industry is built over time. First, the theory. Then the infrastructure. Then the operational practice of prediction, decision making, and learning.

Cognitive Error
---------------

Kahneman / Tversky
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky offer observations into how fallible the human mind is in the most common of circumstances. The classification of System 1 and System 2 thinking is highly relevant to this area of critical thinking around risk.

.. [#] Kahneman, D. (2015). Thinking, fast and slow.

Meehl / Dawes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Paul E. Meehl and Robyn Dawes work in prediction inspired a scientific full fledged assault on the credibility of expert prediction. Comprehensive findings that mechanical statistical models beat experts at prediction.

N. Taleb
~~~~~~~~
Taleb explores the limitations of our ability to understand randomness and the nature of randomness. Preparation for inevitable surprise, and the emergence of Black Swans, is Taleb's core message.

Intelligence Processing
-----------------------

Sherman Kent
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sherman Kent is considered a pioneer of intelligence analysis, and brought probabilistic rigor into the National Intelligence Estimate.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is research around Canada's application of modern intelligence processing and its effectiveness. The basis of this is all probabilistic.
