Simple Risk Measurement
=======================

:doc:`Simple Risk Measurement </index>` is written to help you measure complicated risks.

.. note::
  In draft. Please send feedback to @magoo

If you are motivated by risk problems and are frustrated by how difficult they are to measure, you may find this documentation useful. Simple Risk Measurement can get you started towards a comprehensive and scientific approach to risk. It is designed to enhance subject matter experts who work with risk, especially those who mitigate complex risks on an ongoing basis.

You should be able to measure risk on a napkin or organize a rocket launch with these methods.

See :doc:`risk </risk/defined>` to better understand the risk problem in engineering.

How does this help me?
------------------------------------------

You may be enthusiastic about some of the following risk problems:

Is a risk worth mitigating?
  We can gather quantitative data that informs decisions to invest in a mitigation, (or not).

Has a specific risk gotten better or worse?
  We can measure a risk over time and observe differences if it is being mitigated (or not).

Which mitigation option(s) should we choose?
  We can measure many mitigation options and compare them quantitatively.

How do we measure many risks?
  We can organize many risks that are being measured and use them to inform broader risks.

Have we spent enough time identifying new risks?
  We can measure if further risk assessments are likely to reveal new risks, (or not).
