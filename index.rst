Simple Risk Management
======================

:doc:`Simple Risk Management </index>` is a quantitative toolbox of simple methods that support risk measurement.

It is designed to be reliant on subject matter experts who are informed by evidence. It should be useful to those who professionally mitigate risk. It is different from top-down methods founded by governance or compliance needs.

If you are already motivated by risk problems, you may find these techniques useful, well researched, and with plentiful industry examples.

With these methods, you should be able to measure risk on a cocktail napkin, or launch a rocket ship into space.

How does this help me?
------------------------------------------

You may be enthusiastic about some of the following risk problems:

Is a risk worth mitigating?
  We need to decide whether a risk is important enough to require our attention or investment. We must express the importance of a risk in quantitative terms if we want to inform these decisions.

Has a specific risk gotten better or worse?
  Risk can change over time, especially if we are actively mitigating them or are observing changes in the context they exist in.

Which mitigation option(s) should we choose?
  When presented with competing options with which we can mitigate a risk, we use methods to evaluate each option and decide upon the most effective strategies involved.

How do we measure so many risks?
  It may become important to highlight areas of risk *inside* of many other risks. Sometimes, more focused areas can be our largest problems, and we must represent them.

Have we spent enough time identifying new risks?
  You'll find that "unknown unknowns" can become "knowns" with effort, and deciding how to budget that effort can save time for mitigating your "knowns".
