Will Twitter experience a severe outage before January 30?

There's a lot of speculation that Twitter may have an outage due to [severe layoffs](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63672307) following Elon Musk's recent purchase.

We put together the following conditions, and used a Slack bot to elicit forecasts against it.

A "severe outage" would need to include all of the following:

1. Coverage by a major US newspaper of record describing a Twitter outage as widespread, large, severe, critical, painful, or embarrassing.  
2. A account of measurable downtime of over an hour by a US based newspaper of record.
3. Any inability for Twitter users to read or create tweets over the course of this time.

The presence of a status page or other indicator of an outage (eg: FailWhale) indicating a failure for over an hour will automatically count as a "severe outage".

The outage cannot be caused by a larger internet ecosystem outage, unrelated censorship. The outage must occur before, or on, January 31, 2023. Final judgement will come from interpretation of the rules by @magoo on February 1st 2023.

## Results

The panel expects a `72.8%` chance of observing a severe outage by January 30, 2023. Here's how their forecasts were distributed:

A panel of 26 individuals I organized were [elicited](/risk-measurement/docs/estimation/expert-elicitation/) for a [forecast](/risk-measurement/docs/intro/for-noobs) suggesting the individual's probabilistic assessment of whether this scenario would take place.

That's me at 30% in the image, by the way. I was very surprised the panel shot so high.

## What's next?

We wait to see if the criteria are met before 2023-01-30.

If you'd like, you can post your own forecast and compare with us in January 2023. Make sure you do it soon. Put your forecast on Twitter or commit it to a repository.

The forecast will be [scored](https://magoo.github.io/risk-measurement/docs/estimation/calibration/) in January 2023. Since we've thoroughly covered the discussions we've had, we can review where we were on/off the right track.
