Will Okta disclose a breach into one or more customer environments before June 1 2022?

A [tweet](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1506109152665382920) set off a fast moving conversation about a potential incident at Okta.

- [CEO Tweet](https://twitter.com/toddmckinnon/status/1506184721922859010?s=20&t=bHMwwkoKsv2HzItATOZajA)
- [Statement 1](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/03/okta-official-statement-on-lapsus-claims/)
- [Attacker statements](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1506341803225616384)

A blue team concern is whether to trust Okta's initial statements. Trusting Okta's guidance would avoid potentially unnecessary work, but any mistakes in their analysis of the incident might have allowed an adversary to walk through your SSO defenses.

More advanced blue teams might have a smooth experience rolling credentials in any case. They can take mitigation efforts without hesitating much, but this is not the case where blue teams need to make careful tradeoffs to avoid unnecessary work.

This brings us to the forecast. A better understanding of whether Okta will make further concessions about a breach becomes informative to leadership decisions about efforts to apply here. This scenario was designed to predict whether those future concessions may happen and whether the scope might be larger than Okta's initial communications.

We created a forecast that closed at 5pm PST on 2022-03-22.

`14` panelists were elicited with an average of `43.57% Yes`. This varied widely, with `Yes` forecasts ranging from `5-95%`.

Okta provided updates soon afterward. These were initially thought to conclude the scenario as `Yes`, but more recent communications from Okta cloud judgement even further.

- [Statement 3](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/03/oktas-investigation-of-the-january-2022-compromise/)

Judgement on this forecast is expected to be difficult. The wording Okta has used in the discussion so far has muddied whether customers were impacted by this access or not. Currently, we are finding ourselves re-interpreting Okta's statements and whether they mean customer data or networks were actually accessed by the adversary or not.

In a few days this post will be updated with Brier Score.
