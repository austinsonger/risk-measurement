Will Okta disclose a breach into one or more customer environments before June 1 2022?

A [tweet](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1506109152665382920) set off a fast moving conversation about a potential incident at Okta.

- [Statement 1](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/03/okta-official-statement-on-lapsus-claims/)
- [Statement 2](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/03/updated-okta-statement-on-lapsus/)
- [Statement 3](https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/03/oktas-investigation-of-the-january-2022-compromise/)
- [Attacker statements](https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1506341803225616384)

`14` panelists were elicited with an average of `43.57% Yes`. This varied widely, with `Yes` forecasts ranging from `5-95%`.

Judgement on this forecast is expected to be difficult. The wording Okta has used in the discussion so far has muddied whether customers were "impacted" by this access or not. Currently, we are finding ourselves re-interpreting Okta's statements and whether they mean customers were actually accessed by the adversary or not.

In a few days this post will be updated with Brier Score.
