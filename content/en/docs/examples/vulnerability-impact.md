Impact can be frustrating to work with because a variety of undesirable outcomes may or may not happen. Unless we're forced to translate everything into dollar values, we can work with whatever quantities we're concerned about.

## Example Scenarios

Let's assume the following scenario:

{{< alert >}}
**Scenario**: 
An SQL injection is discovered in our product.
{{< /alert >}}

These scenarios assume that an SQL injection has already been exploited. 

- **Users Compromised**: Sensitive data for more than 100 customers will be impacted.
- **Downtime**: Downtime for incident response will exceed 1 hour.
- **Engineering Response Hours**: More than 8 engineering hours will be spent on response.
- **Growth Accounting**: A reduction from projected `new`, `expanded`, or `retained` by more than `1%`.
- **Headlines**: One or more national newspaper headlines.

## Example Intervals
Another step up is to elicit a credible interval. For instance, a min-and-max range (5/95% percentile) where we believe the true value will lane.


{{< alert >}}
**Scenario**: 
A session secret leaked has leaked to an adversary.
{{< /alert >}}

Here's an example impact assessment with intervals that assume the secret has already leaked.

### 75% Interval forecasts
- **Users Compromised**:  0-1.5M Customers (75% Interval)
- **Downtime**: 0-9 days (75% Interval)
- **Engineering Response Hours**: 40-500 hours (75% Interval)
- **Growth Accounting**: 1k-100k Churn this month (75% Interval)
- **Headlines**: 0-5 Headlines (75% Interval)

It's possible that these can all be decomposed further into a uniform dollar amount. However, the abstractions themselves are likely to be informative enough for decision making and the decomposition work will require time and effort.
