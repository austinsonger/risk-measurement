Do you want to forecast stuff? You're in the right place!

## I don't know how!
First, don't worry! This is actually very simple.

Overall, the process is **forecast**, **talk**, **update forecast**.

First, get a forecast in. This is easy:

- All you're being asked is to type some _numbers_. 
- You won't have to show or discuss your work.
- You're not committing to anything long term.
- Forecasts are _default anonymous_.
- You will finalize it later, so just get something down.

Next, we _talk_ about our forecasts. Talking is optional! You can lurk where the discussion is happening instead. What is important is that you _think critically_ about the problem. Review other perspectives. Contributing to the discussion helps the whole process and is very much welcomed. You can share your actual forecast, or just your reasoning, or discuss points others have brought up.

After you've had time to work through the problem with others, you have a chance to _update your forecast_.

Here's some discussion on the numbers you might be asked for.

If you're being **asked for an interval**: That's two numbers, a _maximum_ and a _minimum_, assuming some percentage of confidence that the future value will land within it. That confidence level (like, say, `90%`) is usually assigned and shared between everyone.

For example: Jelly beans in a jar: `100` (a minimum) to `200` (a maximum).

If you're being **asked about a scenario**: That's few probabilities that you believe some outcomes will happen over others.

For example: A `15%` chance it will rain tomorrow.

You'll probably be given a link to a forecasting tool (like e6e) or a spreadsheet to collaborate in.

There's likely going to be some discussion about people's forecasts that you can participate in as well. You might want to update your forecast after seeing discussion, and that's very much encouraged. 

## What happens next?
We wait for the actual outcome to occur. Then, we take a look at our individual and average forecasts. Hindsight analysis allows us to better understand what our beliefs were, why they may have been wrong, and how to improve them in the future.

Some analysis will probably be written about the discussion, the measurements, and the actual outcome. These are usually shared more widely, while hiding individual participants (unless they want to step forward and discuss their forecasts).
