<h1>Measurement<a class="headerlink" href="#measurement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We often use instruments to measure things. For instance, a ruler to measure the size of a table. However, we rely on estimation when instruments do not exist for our area of measurement.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is well understood that all forms of measurement are, in essence, an <a class="reference external" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/measurement-science/">approximation</a>. This is represented in philosophy and more practically in <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee_for_Guides_in_Metrology">international standards</a>.</p>
<p>As an example, any wooden ruler you might own is an approximation of many intermediary approximations to a standard unit of measurement stored in an underground vault in France.</p>
<p>In risk, we are concerned with future events and their impacts. No instrument exists that can <em>directly</em> measure future events. As a result, we often find ourselves approximating the most likely outcome by understanding past events or reference classes.</p>
<p>An estimation of a likelihood is typically called forecast.</p>
<p>As the role of information becomes more prevalent in a forecast, we can reduce (but never eliminate) our uncertainty in a given scenario.</p>
<p>The primary feature of this documentation is to make practical risk as vulnerable to quantitative techniques as possible, and forecasting is one of these important methods.</p>
<div class="section" id="some-thoughts-on-definitions">
<h2>Some thoughts on definitions:<a class="headerlink" href="#some-thoughts-on-definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By it’s <a class="reference internal" href="../introduction/principles.html"><span class="doc">principles</span></a>, this documentation is opinionated on the usage of some risk language. <em>Estimations</em> are a form of approximation for any unknown value. A <em>forecast</em> is a an estimation of a value that doesn’t exist yet. An estimate is not necessarily a forecast, but a forecast is an estimate.</p>
<p>There are grey areas for these terms. For instance, an unknown quantity may also be a future value. These will be worked out as this documentation as opportunities to simplify may arise. The authors are already aware of industry conflicting definitions.</p>
<p>A <em>prediction</em> does not necessarily mean a “100% belief”, but should probably be avoided as it can be interpreted poorly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="forecasting">
<h1>Forecasting<a class="headerlink" href="#forecasting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Forecasting is a disciplined practice to estimate the likelihoods and impacts of future events. It is a subject matter with over a half-century of multidisciplinary research into risk, decision making, and predictions.</p>
<p>Most of this research has concluded that human intuition is very poor at prediction, but it can be improved when rigorous methods are used to support our strengths.</p>
<p>When culturally supported and invested in, predictive approaches to risk have great opportunity for engineers to attack large risks methodically.</p>
<div class="section" id="calibration">
<h2>Calibration<a class="headerlink" href="#calibration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Forecasts often include a value of “confidence” associated with them. For instance, “<em>I am 50% sure it will rain tomorrow.</em>” would indicate that the forecaster will be historically wrong in half of the instances where they’ve made a <em>50%</em> claim.</p>
<p>Volumes of research show that humans do not follow this pattern by default. An uncalibrated individual may use the phrase “<em>I’m 90% sure</em>” and display a track record of being far worse, as an example.</p>
<p>Research shows that individuals can be very easily calibrated with minimal training, and regular practice supports this as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keeping-score">
<h2>Keeping Score<a class="headerlink" href="#keeping-score" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Forecasts that include their associated confidence can make use of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier Score</a> to record accuracy over time. This is simply calculated as the “Squared Error”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="types-of-forecasts">
<h2>Types of Forecasts<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-forecasts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A scenario can prompt for several types of answers to create a forecast. Depending on the risk you are hoping to measure, you may want to prompt an expert for a different type of answer.</p>
<div class="section" id="yes-or-no">
<h3>Yes or No<a class="headerlink" href="#yes-or-no" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The simplest type of forecast asks an expert for their belief of a binary outcome. For instance:</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Scenario</p>
<p class="last">Will it rain tomorrow? (Yes / No)</p>
</div>
<p>A forecaster may express themselves by saying Yes: 60%, No: 40%, if they believe it’s more likely that not to rain. Or for instance, Yes: 0.01%, No: 99.99% if the forecaster lives in the desert.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="over-under">
<h3>Over / Under<a class="headerlink" href="#over-under" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To include some aspect of “impact” in a risk, you can bake an over / under value into the scenario.</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Scenario</p>
<p class="last">Will there be more than <strong>three inches</strong> of rainfall tomorrow? (Yes / No)</p>
</div>
<p>This is similar to the previous forecast, but instead adds a numeric condition that must be met. This is useful when investigating the likelihood that some risk will meet a threshold or tolerance level you need to better understand. For instance, there may be a legal reason to close down schools with a certain height of snow, or maybe a certain amount of losses that your insurance couldn’t cover.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="confidence-intervals">
<h3>Confidence Intervals<a class="headerlink" href="#confidence-intervals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A confidence interval represents a range of possible values, and also includes a percentage belief that the outcome will fall into it. A forecaster would then expand their range of values to increase their expression of uncertainty, and an engineer’s efforts would widen or narrow this range. For example:</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Scenario</p>
<p class="last">Our police station has responded to an unannounced protest outside of City Hall. (# of arrests, 95% confidence)</p>
</div>
<p>A forecaster may answer this with an interval of 0-15 arrests. If, for instance, they were asked for a more aggressive forecast (say, 70%), they may answer a more narrow range that results in a higher rate of being wrong. An example of a 70% confidence forecast for the same question could be 2-7 arrests.</p>
<p>A visual example of a percentage belief that an unknown value will end up within this range when revealed.:</p>

<p>To summarize, a forecaster would provide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An interval (min-max)</li>
<li>A percentage belief the outcome lies within.</li>
</ul>
<p>A scenario can also demand the percentage belief beforehand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="probability-distributions">
<h3>Probability Distributions<a class="headerlink" href="#probability-distributions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some forecasts may include many outcomes. For instance:</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Scenario</p>
<p class="last">Our potential customer has made a decision regarding their request for business.</p>
</div>
<p>This could be answered with multiple options, like (A: Us, B: Competitor 1, C: Competitor 2, D, Competitor 3, E: No Decision / Walkout.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="skills">
<h2>Skills<a class="headerlink" href="#skills" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="divide-and-choose">
<h3>Divide and Choose<a class="headerlink" href="#divide-and-choose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Divide and choose is a mental heuristic to determine if odds are fair or not. It is similar to the children’s “fairness” concept where one child divides some candy, and another child picks first.</p>
<p>This method prevents the first child from creating an uneven amount of candy, as they won’t be the one making a decision based on it.</p>
<p>As forecasting can often be related to gambling or a decision market, it can appear advantageous to “win” a forecast and aggressively assign likelihood to one option or another. A goal of forecasting is to assign “fair odds” that represent the whole uncertainty associated with an event or value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="principle-of-indifference">
<h3>Principle of Indifference<a class="headerlink" href="#principle-of-indifference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference">principle of indifference</a> is a rule of thumb that divides a likelihood across all of its options. For instance, 50/50% or 25/25/25/25%.</p>
<p>When faced with these odds, a forecaster may find themselves disagreeing with them. If this is the case, it’s likely that the forecaster has opinions they may express numerically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-absurdity-test">
<h3>The Absurdity Test<a class="headerlink" href="#the-absurdity-test" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The absurdity test assigns extreme and irrationally formed likelihoods or values to a forecast, testing the opinions of a forecaster. For instance, “A small child can eat between zero and one million pies in a sitting.”</p>
<p>When faced with such a test, a forecaster may be encouraged to start making a forecast <em>less</em> absurd. For instance “Well, a child can at least eat half of a pie, and maybe up to five pies, in extraordinary circumstances.”</p>
<p>This form of test has been used as an interview prompt in psychological research since the 1900’s.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reference-class">
<h3>Reference Class<a class="headerlink" href="#reference-class" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When data is not available to study a risk, alternative data may suffice as a reference. For instance, the history of reversals in the Supreme Court may inform a type of case that may be considered unprecedented.</p>
