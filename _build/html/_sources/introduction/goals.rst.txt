Principles
==========

Make "risk" a measurable engineering subject matter.

- Make "risk" a specific concept with useful professional tooling when used.
- Make measurement useful and time efficient from the ground up. (Brushing your teeth).
- Make *any risk* vulnerable to these methods.
- Make risk management across an organization more continuous and less heavy handed.
- Worship the post mortem to support validated learning for our industry.
- Keep math extremely simple until an organization wants dedicated hiring for it.
- Risk is a small part of overall goals. It doesn't drive everything.
