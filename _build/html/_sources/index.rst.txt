Simple Risk Management
======================

:doc:`Simple Risk Management </index>` is a toolbox of simple methods that help support risk measurement, and decisions.

It is designed to be an accessible practice for people who are closest to risk, and opposite from top-down methods founded by governance or compliance efforts.

If you are already motivated by risk problems, you may find these techniques useful, well researched, and with plentiful industry examples.

How does this help me?
------------------------------------------

You may be enthusiastic about some of the following risk problems:

Is this risk worth mitigating?
  We need to decide whether a risk is important enough to require our attention or investment. We must express the importance of a risk in quantitative terms if we want to inform these decisions.

Has a specific risk gotten better or worse?
  Risk can change over time, especially if we are actively mitigating them or are observing changes in the context they exist in.

Which mitigation option(s) should we choose?
  When presented with competing options with which we can mitigate a risk, we use methods to evaluate each option and decide upon the most effective strategies involved.

How do we measure so many risks?
  It may become important to highlight areas of risk *inside* of many other risks. Sometimes, more focused areas can be our largest problems, and we must represent them.

Have we spent enough time identifying new risks?
  You'll find that "unknown unknowns" can become "knowns" with effort, and deciding how to budget that effort can save time for mitigating your "knowns".
