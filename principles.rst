Principles
==========

The following principles are guiding the opinions behind this documentation.

Defend against the ambiguity of risk language.
----------------------------------------------
Too often we find ourselves speaking about `completely different subjects <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/risk/>`_ when we discuss "Risk".

We must protect ourselves from letting conversations about risk slip into wildly unaligned conversations comparable to unstructured debates about love, or art.

Risk has quantitative foundations we can agree on, and known methods for measuring some of its more subjective characteristics. We can still pursue scientific goals while acknowledging that the "undesirable" aspect of risk may be wholly subjective.

The opinion of this documentation is that risk discussions should be structured around :doc:`scenarios </risk/scenarios>`

Make risk measurement accessible to those closest to the mitigation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Risk measurement methods are quickly disposed from regular practice if they are too cumbersome to wield. An engineer tasked with risk mitigation tasks should be able to measure their work, independently.

If the cost for measurement effort requires full time staff, dedicated software, and more than a couple hours of effort, it likely won't be leveraged closer to when a risk originates.

The efforts involved with risk measurement should be simplified and centralized around likelihoods and impacts that don't exceed what can be easily learned with basic math.

Remove industry specific instructions from risk measurement.
------------------------------------------------------------
As soon as industry specific methods creep into risk measurement, we are biasing our approach with prescriptive influence and/or agendas. Risk is a universal aspect of many disciplines, and its backbone can be found in any industry and reflected here.

Celebrate the "post mortem" to support validated learning.
----------------------------------------------------------
While we use estimation methods to compensate for spotty data, we must invest in infrastructure to observe and share failures to better inform us about risks. Our goal is to measurably progress away from uncertainty as we learn more about the root causes of our failures.

Assume failure and assume the limitations of prediction.
--------------------------------------------------------
We invest and measure responsive capabilities as we invest in prevention. We understand that risks cannot be properly enumerated, and we measure and understand impacts where prediction fails.

These methods should be designed to rapidly harness failures, measurably improve on our understanding of why failures happen, and develop constructs to limit future harm.

Appreciate that risk is a single decision making factor.
--------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes it is better to work on a risk that has momentum, resource, interest, and other management observations before one that measures higher. Risk is a small part of organizational needs, but risk should be understood properly.

Fully quantitative workplaces do not exist.
---------------------------------------------
Even the most mature risk organization suffer from subjective, qualitative, or irrational decision making. Measurement approaches must be effective under these circumstances, so that they efforts can be observed and measured in the future regardless of how they began. More rational decision making cannot happen without starting somewhere. This documentation should celebrate environments that are just starting to measure risk, and assume a variety of limitations and external influences.
